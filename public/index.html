<p>Welcome! If your firm is looking for an extra set of hands for the 2024 tax season, I&rsquo;ve put this portfolio together to share how I might be able to help.</p>
<p>I am an EA candidate based in Austin, Texas. I&rsquo;m transitioning into tax prep after a decade in digital audience development. (My literary career has been extremely rewarding! I just keep prioritizing financial literacy, so I&rsquo;m leaning into that interest.)</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m currently looking for part-time opportunities to gain hands-on experience preparing tax returns. That said, if any of my marketing or tech skills pop out at you and make you think, &ldquo;Well hey, we actually need some help with this other thing, too,&rdquo; lay it on me! I&rsquo;m always game to address existing needs.</p>
<p>Here you&rsquo;ll find links to details about my progress (on track to earn my EA credential in February 2024), recent CE credits I&rsquo;ve earned, and my history with software and tech. I&rsquo;ve been location independent since 2017, so I&rsquo;m more than comfortable working remotely, but I&rsquo;m just as open to commuting to a local firm.</p>
<p>Thanks for joining me! Reach out to let me know what you&rsquo;re working on by emailing <a href="mailto:catherine@cusick.cc">catherine@cusick.cc</a>. I&rsquo;d be happy to help.</p>
