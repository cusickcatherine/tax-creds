Here's a visualization of my history discovering various tools, coding languages, and online communities.

I built this chart in Datawrapper. [Open it in a new tab](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/MKPpj/?v=27).

I use everything in **Keepers** regularly. The tools listed under **Would Use Again** have all helped me before, and I'd be happy to pick them back up any time. The tech in **RIP** has either sunset or rebranded beyond recognition. I think alternatives for the few under **There Are Better Ways** are either easier or more ethical.
