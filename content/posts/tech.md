Here's a visualization of my history discovering various tools, coding languages, and online communities.

I built this chart in Datawrapper. [Open it in a new tab](https://www.datawrapper.de/_/MKPpj/?v=27).

I use the **Keepers** regularly. I'd be happy to revisit the tools listed under **Would Use Again** any time. The tech in **RIP** has either sunset or rebranded beyond recognition. As for **There Are Better Ways**, I think alternatives are either easier or more ethical.
