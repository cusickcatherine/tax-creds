Welcome! If your firm is looking for an extra set of hands for the 2024 tax season, I've put this portfolio together to share how I might be able to help.

I am an EA candidate based in Austin, Texas. I'm transitioning into tax prep after a [decade](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WoHW8yeT_w5llyg5-xaJcS3Xd8vY-gEL/view?usp=sharing) in membership, marketing, and digital audience development. I'm currently looking for part-time opportunities to gain hands-on experience preparing tax returns. That said, if any of my marketing or tech skills pop out at you and make you think, "Well hey, we actually need some help with this other thing, too," lay it on me! I'm always game to address existing needs.

Here you'll find links to details about my SEE Exam progress, recent CE credits, and my history adopting new software and tech. I've been location independent since 2017, so I'm more than comfortable working remotely, but I'm just as open to commuting to a local firm.

Thanks for joining me! Reach out to let me know what you're working on by emailing catherine@cusick.cc. I'd be happy to help.
