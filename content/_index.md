Welcome! If your firm is looking for an extra set of hands, I'd love to help.

I am an Enrolled Agent based in Austin, Texas. I passed [SEE1](https://scorereports.prometric.com/D6PLQHYGGQCQD3JMRBRFX5NVXM3XLZSQ) in September 2023, [SEE2](https://scorereports.prometric.com/V4WM7HR4YTTQD3JMRBRFX5NVXM3XLZSQ) in January 2024, and [SEE3](https://scorereports.prometric.com/T2HDTP6GSSDQD3JMRBRFX5NVXM3XLZSQ) in February. I was officially issued my [EA credential](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KToUjqLX1p2V1eM75sMNk3hoGtxrjGr9/view?usp=share_link) as of June 17, 2024.

I'm transitioning into tax prep after a [decade](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WoHW8yeT_w5llyg5-xaJcS3Xd8vY-gEL/view?usp=sharing) in membership, marketing, and digital audience development. I volunteered with VITA for the 2024 tax season through Foundation Communities' [Tax Help Program](https://foundcom.org/austin-tax-help/), preparing 50+ returns across [three sites](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKma6OKoa4Yco2pfaWuhtnXHIfkcaZLk/view?usp=share_link). I loved the experience, and rejoined the team in June to continue volunteering year-round. 

I'm currently looking for opportunities to gain more hands-on experience preparing both individual and business tax returns. I'm happy to pitch in wherever I can be most helpful, from bookkeeping to advisory services and representation. I am also a big systems thinker — I'm a huge [Donella Meadows](https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/thinking-in-systems/) fan — and love to document workflows, improve processes, conserve resources, and preserve sanity.

Here you'll find more details about my credentials, recent CE credits, and my history adopting new software and tech. My background in analytics and web development have made me more than comfortable working remotely, but I'm just as open to commuting to spend time with colleagues in person.

Let me know what you're working on by emailing catherine@cusick.cc. I'd love to discuss ways I might be able to contribute to your firm's growth and help your team meet your clients' needs.
