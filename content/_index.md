Welcome! If your firm is looking for an extra set of hands, I'd love to help.

I am an Enrolled Agent based in Austin, Texas. I passsed [SEE1](https://scorereports.prometric.com/D6PLQHYGGQCQD3JMRBRFX5NVXM3XLZSQ) in September 2023, [SEE2](https://scorereports.prometric.com/V4WM7HR4YTTQD3JMRBRFX5NVXM3XLZSQ) in January 2024, and [SEE3](https://scorereports.prometric.com/T2HDTP6GSSDQD3JMRBRFX5NVXM3XLZSQ) in February 2024. I was officially issued my EA card as of June 17, 2024.

I'm transitioning into tax prep after a [decade](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WoHW8yeT_w5llyg5-xaJcS3Xd8vY-gEL/view?usp=sharing) in membership, marketing, and digital audience development. I volunteered with VITA for the 2024 tax season through Foundation Communities' [Tax Help Program](https://foundcom.org/austin-tax-help/), preparing 50+ returns across [three sites](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1IKma6OKoa4Yco2pfaWuhtnXHIfkcaZLk/view?usp=share_link). I loved the experience, and rejoined the team in June to continue volunteering year-round. 

I'm currently looking for opportunities to gain more hands-on experience preparing both individual and business tax returns. I'm happy to pitch in wherever I can be most helpful with ongoing tasks, from bookeeping to representation services.

Here you'll find details about my recent CE credits, and my history adopting new software and tech. I'm more than comfortable working remotely, but I'm just as open to commuting to a local firm.

Let me know what you're working on by emailing catherine@cusick.cc.
